# SYNOPSIS 

This is an example REST web server and client implemented using a header-only package 
from [`cpp-httplib`](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib). This can be built and ran 
as a REST server to instantiate a Network class, configure it and run it as a NetworkAPI 
application.

This is a light-weight server.  If you need a full production REST server we suggest 
replacing this with one implemented from Boost.Beast.
